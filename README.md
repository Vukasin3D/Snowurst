Snowurst is a fork of the popular Wurst Client, focusing on creating a cleaner, more performant, and aesthetically pleasing user experience.

This project began as a learning endeavor into Minecraft mod development and has evolved into a full-fledged personalization of the Wurst client, bringing new themes, features, and quality-of-life improvements.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **New Visual Themes:** Features the default "Snowurst" (white) and "DarkUI" themes for a more modern interface. (RainbowUI is unchanged)
* **Streamlined Focus:** Removes non-essential features from the original client to focus on the most important and useful modules.
* **Open Source:** Inherits the original GPL-3.0 license, ensuring the project remains open and collaborative.
